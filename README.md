Conversational Image Recognition Chatbot for Women Safety Analytics
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a Conversational Image Recognition Chatbot designed to enhance women's safety by analyzing images for potential threats. The chatbot leverages AI/ML techniques to process images and provide real-time insights on safety, making it easier for women to get immediate assistance in dangerous situations.

Features
Image Recognition: The chatbot can identify objects, people, or scenarios from uploaded images.
Conversational Interface: Users can interact with the chatbot through a simple text-based interface to get safety advice.
Threat Detection: The system flags any suspicious or dangerous situations based on image analysis.
Safety Recommendations: Based on the recognized objects and context, the chatbot provides safety guidelines or alerts.
Technologies Used
Machine Learning: For training the image recognition model.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): To interpret user queries and interact in a conversational manner.
Python: For developing the core model and chatbot logic.
TensorFlow/Keras: For image recognition tasks.
Flask/Django: For hosting the web interface (if applicable).
